# 🌆 Feature Extraction for Urban Sprawl

## 🚀 About the Project
Urban sprawl represents the unplanned expansion of urban areas into natural landscapes, posing challenges to sustainable development. This project leverages geospatial data and advanced feature extraction techniques to analyze urban growth patterns, identify affected regions, and facilitate data-driven urban planning.

The methodology integrates feature extraction algorithms with clustering techniques to detect and classify urban sprawl zones effectively.
